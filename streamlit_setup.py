The correct selection of antibiotics is critical to ensure optimal treatment outcomes, prevent the development of resistance, and minimize adverse effects.   \n  By integrating the latest research and guidelines, this system supports clinicians in making evidence-based decisions that are tailored to the specific health needs of each patient. This not only enhances the efficacy of treatment but also contributes to the broader effort to curb antibiotic resistance, a growing concern in veterinary as well as human medicine.')
